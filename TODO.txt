DOING NOW
We are scrapping every cinema page to get their films and its times
Refract GetJsonContent method

GENERAL
- We already have a collention with all the cinemas. Loop that collection to get just those original versions films on their board.
- Move all configurations and parameters to mongoDb and create CinevoConfiguration class
How to download images c# :)
Find examples of cinema pages (with its films) with all possible data to scrap and do the same for films pages.
- Process to get just the differences between jsons/collections
- Copy HtmlFiles folder from scrapper to test solution every time we build

DATABASE
- One document with all tonws, every town will have a collection of cinemas and every cinema will have a collection of films with a collection of showings
- Make one document for old date and another one for the new data, much easier to compare data and make inserts/deletes

APIS
- Will make an api using WebApi (.net) to get films info on demmand
- Will build another api using Node (js) to make a backend to manage the app


ACCOUNT
- Everything to do 

ERROR HANDLING
- Immprove error helper
- Add try/catch wherever they needed

INVESTIGATE
- Find out why the test for checking that two file are equal get considerably more time thant the others

ADDINGS
- We are reading the html file twice to get town and cinemas data. We can make it doing it once, it's the same file (not important for now)
- Show cinemas near me wiht original version films on map
- Add you original version film
- Update data randomly (add system configuration)

FRONTEND
- In React :)
	FILTERS
		Town, Cinema, Film, Distance

BACKEND
- Node and express

INFRASCTRUCTURE
- The cinevo scrapper will update just once a day while I'm having my laptop on
- I'd like to use docker for the front and back end
- I'll need another domain 

Once everything is done will start with react native
